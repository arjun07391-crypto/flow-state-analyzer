## Core Features

### 1. Smart Activity Input
- **Chat-style input box** - just type what you're doing
- **Automatic IST timestamping** - time captured when you submit
- Understands both styles:
  - "started coding" → begins tracking, waits for stop
  - "having dinner" → ends previous activity, starts new one
  - "stopped working" → ends current activity
- AI parses your natural language to understand intent

### 2. AI-Powered Understanding & Categorization
- Detects whether you're starting, stopping, or switching activities
- Auto-categorizes into: **Work, Coding, Meetings, Meals, Exercise, Sleep, Leisure, Social, Commute, Personal Care**
- Handles casual language: "grabbing food", "gym time", "netflix break", "crashed early"

### 3. Live Activity Timeline
- Visual timeline of your day, updating in real-time
- Color-coded blocks by category
- Auto-calculated durations
- Quick edit/delete for corrections
